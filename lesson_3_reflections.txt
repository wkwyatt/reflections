When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to work on a project as a group

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather
than having Git automatically stay up to date with your
remote repository?


If someone else updates the log and you are not aware of the 
changes.  Or you may make changes you aren't sure you want
 to keep on GitHub until you get some feedback from other 
 users.
 
 Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
 
 Forks are clones of someone elses repo on GitHub, you would use that
 when you want to make changes to someone elses files but don't have the
 access to their repo.  Clones are local clones of files and folders you have 
 access to, you would clone a repo from github or files from another users
 computer.  Branches are saved separately from the master to allow for experimentation
 and new development without having to change the main version of a file
 
 What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the
 remote stored locally?
 
 The benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally
 would be to see what changes have been made in comparison to the work that you 
 may have done on a repo.
