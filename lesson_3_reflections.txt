When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to work on a project as a group

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather
than having Git automatically stay up to date with your
remote repository?


If someone else updates the log and you are not aware of the 
changes.  Or you may make changes you aren't sure you want
 to keep on GitHub until you get some feedback from other 
 users.
